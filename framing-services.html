      			<div class="testimonial-text"><p>In the past three years I have had about thirty pictures, large and small, framed by Manders Picture Framing, Inc. Their work is exceptional. Each time I bring in an art work, I receive attentive care and concern in selecting frame types and just the right color accent to enhance the work with a double mat.</p>
      				<p>I highly recommend their professional and artistic excellence. AND the price is right!</p>
